An old (very old) proof of concept trading bot using SMA and EMA

This is *BAD* code. A while ago I created this bot to explore using SMA and EMA for market prediction. The data (in the market test files) can be plotted using `plot.py` but it's very non-user friendly and I forgot how to use it.

I publised this repository because I plan to using it as reference in the future to build and actual decent trading bot.
